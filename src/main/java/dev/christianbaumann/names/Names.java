    // which causes problems when you realise that you have to choose
    // between words like "accumulator" and "accuracy",
    // or "between position" and "point of sale".
    // Abbreviations tend to suffer from ambiguity
    // since multiple words often share the same abbreviation.
    // Refactor abbreviations to the complete word,
    // which is easy as long as you know which word that is.
