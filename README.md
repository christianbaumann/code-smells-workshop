2. Follow [this link](https://gitpod.io/new/#https://github.com/christianbaumann/code-smells-workshop) and follow the instructions. When the _New Workspace_ page appears, click _Continue_. (Creating the workspace takes a little while, just be patient)
3. Open [Person.java](src/main/java/dev/christianbaumann/person/Person.java) (`src/main/java/dev/christianbaumann/person/Person.java`) from the file tree on the left and wait for the Java installation to finish.

   After the installation is done, you can right-click into the code, and select _Run test at Cursor_ (to run a single test) or _Run Tests in Current File_ (to run all tests).
